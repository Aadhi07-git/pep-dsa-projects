# 🧠 Churn Prediction Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project predicts **customer churn** using **machine learning classification algorithms**.  
The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a company’s services, helping businesses take proactive measures to retain them.

## 📊 Steps Performed  
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
   - Imported dataset and handled missing values.  
   - Encoded categorical variables for model compatibility.  

2. **Feature Engineering and Scaling**  
   - Scaled numerical features for better model performance.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Trained multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).  
   - Compared accuracy and performance metrics.  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.  

5. **Model Saving**  
   - Saved trained model using `pickle` for future predictions.
